### Translating data between FHIR and the national rheumatic fever care coordination solution (RFCCS)

This section defines mappings to apply between data in RFCCS and the Te Whatu Ora Shared Care API FHIR representations.

The mappings are intended to be bi-directional, that is sector applications can update FHIR representations that can then flow through (Mulesoft) to updates in the RFCCS datastore. 

#### Patient's Current Address -- type, use and currency

Applies to **patient's current address**.

|RFCCS value|Code in FHIR [Address.use](https://fhir.org.nz/ig/base/StructureDefinition-NzAddress-definitions.html#Address.use)|Code in FHIR [Address.type](https://fhir.org.nz/ig/base/StructureDefinition-NzAddress-definitions.html#Address.type)|Date(s) in FHIR [Address.period](https://fhir.org.nz/ig/base/StructureDefinition-NzAddress-definitions.html#Address.period)|
|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|*Home*|`#home`|none|`period.start` SHOULD be set to date when patient registered / address recorded $|
|*Work*|`#work`|none|`period.start` SHOULD be set to date when patient registered / address recorded $|
|*Temporary*|`#temp`|none|`period.start` SHOULD be set to date when patient registered / address recorded $|
|*Inactive*|`#old`|none|No `period`, or `period.end` set to any date in the past ^|
|*Physical*|none|`#physical`|`period.start` SHOULD be set to date when patient registered / address recorded $|
|*Postal*|none|`#postal`|`period.start` SHOULD be set to date when patient registered / address recorded $|
|*Current*|none|none|`period.start` MUST be set to any date in the past, and `period.end`, if specified, must be in the future|


Notes
  
1. 'none' means no code is set - ie. the element is absent in the FHIR JSON representation

1. $ It makes sense to use the date of patient registration as the default value for Address.period.start

1. ^ When there is neither a **use** nor **type** code and `Address.period` is present with the current date in range, this maps to ‘Current’ in RFCCS.  If `Address.period` is missing, the address shall be mapped to 'Inactive'

#### Mapping members of whanau care team to `Patient.contact[]`

As a rheumatic fever patient's whanau care team members need to have contact details, role and relationship to the patient captured, this IG uses `Patient.contact` rather than an instance of `CareTeam` resource.  The data mapping between the national system and FHIR is given by the following table.

|Business data field (national system)|FHIR element of `Patient` resource|FHIR data type|translation|FHIR data example 1|FHIR data example 2|
|:----|:----|:----|:-----|:----|:----|
|care team member role|`.whanauMemberCareRole` **extension**|coding (SNOMED)|-|**$sct#58626002** *Legal Guardian*|**$sct#394738000** *Other related persons (person)*|
|care team member relationship to patient (freetext)|`.whanauMemberCareRelationship` **extension**|string|-|`"mother"`|`"brother in law"`|
|first name|`name.given`|string|-|`"Beryl"`|`"Mike"`|
|last name|`name.family`|string|-|`"Hackett"`|`"Meringue"`|
|primary contact (yes/no)|`.whanauMemberCarePrimary` **extension**|boolean|-|`true`|`false`|
|status (active/inactive)|`.period.start` - `period.end`|datetime x2|Consider member an ACTIVE contact unless BOTH dates are in the past, in which case INACTIVE|`"2023-06-01"` to `"2026-05-31"`|`"2021-01-01"` to `"2021-01-01"`|

#### Language mapping

Applies to **patient's preferred language**.

Patient language is represented in the `Patient.communication.language` element.

Two character codes in the preferred *CommonLanguages* binding are not sufficient to encode the patient languages available in RFCCS.

Therefore the Te Whatu Ora Shared Care API uses **ISO 639-3 three character language codes** which is allowed by the *AllLanguages* (maximum) binding on [Patient.communication.language](StructureDefinition-nz-sharedcare-rheumaticfever-patient-definitions.html#Patient.communication.language.html).

The translation between RFCCS language and FHIR is given in the table below. 

|English name of language|ISO 639-3 language code to use for FHIR mapping|RFCCS Health Cloud language|IANA primary language SUBTAG (BCP47)|
|:----|:----|:----|:----|

#### FHIR representation of Rheumatic Heart Disease Severity

Rheumatic heart disease severity is the driving factor for severity of a patient's rheumatic fever diagnosis.

To adequately encode the severity values supported by the RFCCS application three FHIR elements are used:

1. `Condition.severity`: this is the basic severity classifier in a stock FHIR Condition

1. `RheumaticFeverCondition.rhdSeverity` - this is a profile extension to Condition which allows a specific SNOMED code matching the patient's rheumatic heart disease situation.  
 
1. `RheumaticFeverCondition.assessmentDate` - this is a profile extension to Condition which allows a specific date of assessment to be recorded (the stock `recordedDate` element of Condition is needed to capture the date of diagnosis).  

Translation between the RFCCS RHD severity value and FHIR representation is given by the following table. 

|RFCCS - Rheumatic Heart Disease Severity classification|FHIR [Condition.severity](StructureDefinition-nz-sharedcare-rheumaticfever-condition-definitions.html#Condition.severity) (SNOMED)| [*rhdSeverity*](StructureDefinition-rf-condition-rhdseverity.html) extension in RheumaticFeverCondition / [ValueSet](ValueSet-rf-condition-rhdseverity-code.html)|FHIR NzCondition.long-term-condition indicator ^|
|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|“none”|do not map|**#260413007** None (qualifier value)|TRUE|
|“trivial”|do not map|**#300171000210106** Trivial (qualifier value)|TRUE|
|“mild”|**#255604002** Mild (qualifier value)|**#255604002** Mild (qualifier value)| TRUE|
|“moderate”|**#1255665007** Moderate (qualifier value)|**#1255665007** Moderate (qualifier value)|TRUE |
|“severe”|**#24484000** Severe (severity modifier) (qualifier value)|**#24484000** Severe (severity modifier) (qualifier value)|TRUE |
|“Post valve repair”|**#24484000** Severe (severity modifier) (qualifier value)|Post valve repair or replacement **#59391000119102** History of heart valve repair (situation)| TRUE|
|“Post valve replacement”|**#24484000** Severe (severity modifier) (qualifier value)| **#301561000210102** History of heart valve replacement (situation)|TRUE |
|“Unknown”|do not map|**#261665006** Unknown (qualifier value)|TRUE |


^ Note: The FHIR representation of rheumatic fever condition includes setting the [long-term condition extension](https://fhir.org.nz/ig/base/StructureDefinition-NzCondition-definitions.html#Condition.extension:long-term-condition) as the disease is considered in NZ a long term condition.
