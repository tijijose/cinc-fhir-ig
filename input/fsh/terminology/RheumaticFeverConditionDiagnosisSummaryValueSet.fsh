Title: "Codes for summary diagnosis of the rheumatic fever condition"
Description:  "This value set defines the codes that summarise the diagnosis of a patient with a rheumatic fever condition"
* ^version = "1.0.0"
* ^experimental = false
* ^status = #active

// 18/10/2023 this valueset is defined entirely from codes included from SNOMED.
// Two of the codes are new in the SNOMED NZ edition and not officially published until April 2024
// As a result the valueset published on NZHTS does not work correctly as the codes cannot be looked up.
// (This may be caused by SNOMED licensing or inclusion of SNOMED terms that are in a temporary codesystem)
// we will consider moving to NZHTS canonical in the future but for the meantime this IG is the canonical definition of this valueset
